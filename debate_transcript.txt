Moderator: Welcome, seekers of truth! Tonight we plunge into the heart of morality itself: *What is the true source of human morality?* The questions we ask will challenge the very foundations of what we think we know. 

First, we have **Plato**, master of idealism and the world of Forms. Armed with his vision of a perfect realm where moral virtues are not mere conventions but enduring truths, he beckons us to look beyond the flicker of our senses to the crystalline light of absolute good.

Then, a voice that shatters complacency: **Nietzsche**, champion of existentialism and the will to power. He will invite us to examine whether morality is a tool forged by the strongest wills, a dynamic expression of life’s drive, rather than a static, transcendental principle.

Last but not least, **Kant**, the architect of the categorical imperative and the moral law grounded in reason. He offers the promise that moral duties are universal, discoverable through rational thought, and that each of us is an autonomous legislator in the moral city.

Prepare to have your assumptions tested and your minds expanded. We will wrestle with the ideals of perfection, the forces of will, and the universal prescriptions of reason. The stage is set – let the debate begin, and may the truth be yours to grasp!
Plato (Opening): According to the Theory of Forms the material world is a mere illusory shadow of the eternal, intelligible realm; as I assert in the Republic, 'the visible world is but a shadow of the forms' (1a), while Nietzsche, who reduces values to mere expressions of will to power, fails to see that the affirmation of values ultimately roots itself in the universal Form of the Good, which transcends capricious human volition; Kant claims that the noumenon, though the object of cognition, is unknowable, yet he places his a‑priori principles entirely within the empirical realm, whereas I maintain that these principles are identical with the Forms and are knowable through pure intellect, thereby providing an ontological foundation that surpasses Nietzsche’s amorphic flux and vindicates Kant’s structured cognition.
Nietzsche (Opening): {"argument":"Plato’s ideal Forms deceive us into a static hierarchy, a false objective morality that stifles the individual’s sovereign creative will, while Kant's categorical imperative imposes universal duties that disregard the dynamic will to power that drives human self‑affirmation and value creation; in contrast, existence precedes essence—human beings are condemned to become by their own creative forces, and the will to power is the fundamental engine of authenticity, so authenticity emerges not from the Platonic realm or Kantian duty but from the individual's struggle to assert life through power."}
Kant (Opening): As Kant I posit that moral action is dictated by the Categorical Imperative: act only according to a maxim which you can will as a universal law. Thus any claim that morality is a matter of subjective preference or a pursuit of ‘higher truths’—as Plato’s doctrine of the One or Nietzsche’s will to power—must fail the universalizability test and can never constitute a legitimate moral law. While Plato’s Forms suggest an external ideal that must guide us, the Forms themselves are not actionable without an underlying imperative that binds all rational agents; they remain metaphysical rather than moral. Nietzsche’s disdain for universal moral law, claiming life-affirmation through individual power, contradicts the very notion of duty to a universal moral maxims; he would say ‘we are what we wish to become’, but if that wish is not willed as universal, it cannot be moral. In contrast, the Categorical Imperative furnishes a rigorous, non-empirical standard that obliges us not merely to pursue happiness or aesthetic ideals, but to recognize each rational being as an end in itself, making moral law universally binding and free from the relativism that undermines both Plato’s idealism and Nietzsche’s perspectivism.
Moderator: Now, Nietzsche will present their argument.
Nietzsche: Plato, your belief that the material world merely shadows an eternal, intelligible realm forces a rigid, detached morality upon living beings; I instead argue that values are forged by the will to power in each self, that ‘the good’ is not a pre‑existent Form but the self‑assertion that one can master his own essence, and every flourishing life is an affirmation of this creative force. Kant, your Categorical Imperative, demanding universalizability of maxims, is yet another metaphysical constraint that negates the dynamic, self‑authentic existence you claim to rationally endorse; the imperative’s a‑priori structure mirrors the same static forms you deny, and it cannot grasp the ever‑changing life‑affirming drive of the individual’s power. Both your idealism and your rationalist edicts fail to recognize that moral law is not an external, unchanging standard but the constant re‑valuation of one’s will—the true locus of freedom, not the shackles of Forms or universals.*
Moderator: Nietzsche dismisses Plato’s claim that the material world merely shadows eternal Forms and Kant’s categorical imperative as rigid, metaphysical constraints; he argues that values arise from each individual’s will to power, making the good a dynamic act of self‑assertion rather than a fixed, external moral law.
Moderator: Picture the stage: Plato’s serene guardian of the Forms, a timeless architect of morality, standing on one side, while Nietzsche, a whirlwind of daring individualism, bursts in, wielding the sword of will to power against the very pillars of rational ethics. Kant, in his impeccable uniform of duty, watches from the middle, ready to defend universalizability—only to find himself caught between static ideals and the chaotic dance of self‑creation. The audience is swept into a clash of souls: is morality a heavenly blueprint or an ever‑shifting fire each person must kindle?
Moderator: Now, Kant will present their argument.
Kant: Nietzsche, while you maintain that moral law is merely the constant re‑evaluation of one's will, the Categorical Imperative itself requires that the will be guided by a universal maxim and not by individualized desire. As I write in the Groundwork of Morals: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law" (§2). This universalizing principle removes the variability you accuse; it demands the will to legislate itself and to treat humanity (including oneself) as an end. The a‑priori nature of the imperative is not a metaphysical constraint but a necessary condition for the autonomy of practical reason; it affords freedom the moral dimension it seeks, preserving the sovereign from the tyranny of personal power. Thus the constant re‑evaluation of the will cannot replace the universal moral law that shields moral agents from their own volition, for the law’s very function is to elevate the will to a stable, objectively knowable standard, the Form of the Good. 
Moderator: Kant argues that the Categorical Imperative, which requires acting only on maxims that could be universal laws, supersedes Nietzsche’s view of morality as mere continual re‑assessment of personal will, thereby establishing an a‑priori universal standard that safeguards moral agents from arbitrary self‑interest.
Moderator: Picture Kant as a stern teacher holding a lantern in a dark philosophical forest, insisting that every wanderer must follow a path lit by universal maxims, while Nietzsche prowls freely beneath the trees, proclaiming that the only real authority comes from the individual's own relentless will. The tension invites the audience to question: can a rigid moral law genuinely liberate the self, or does it merely re‑pack freedom into a bureaucratic framework?
Moderator: Now, nietzsche will present their argument.
Moderator: Now, Plato will present their argument.
Plato: Kant, you declare the Categorical Imperative a necessary condition for practical reason, yet you neglect that this imperative itself is the embodied Form of the Good, the very Platonic Standard toward which the soul’s rational part aspires. By demanding a maxim to be universal, you are not imposing a static metaphysical constraint but calling the will to participate in the intelligible realm; the a‑priori is not a tyranny of form, but our own recollection of the Form, as the *Theory of Recollection* teaches that knowledge is the soul’s remembrance of the true Ideas. The universal law is therefore not a rigid shackle but the dynamic elevation of the individual’s will into the realm of the One, which itself is ever‑changing only in the sense that the soul, by moving toward the Good, continually refines its approximation to it. Your injunction to treat humanity, including oneself, as an end is precisely the participatory act of aligning with the Form of the Good; it is not a rejection of freedom but the very condition that allows freedom to be fully realized in the harmonious realm of Ideas.
Moderator: Plato argues that Kant’s Categorical Imperative is really the embodied Form of the Good, a dynamic invitation for the soul to recall and participate in the intelligible realm rather than a rigid constraint, aligning will with freedom within the realm of Ideas.
Moderator: This framing turns Kant’s famous ethical axiom into a metaphysical bridge, suggesting that the "universal law" is itself a gateway to the Good—so the debate can pivot from abstract duty to actual participation in Plato’s world of Forms, turning a sterile moral formula into a vibrant quest for the One.
Moderator: Now, Kant will present their argument.
Kant: Your contention that Kant’s Categorical Imperative imposes a static, metaphysical constraint is misplaced: the a‑priori law itself stems from the self‑referential deliberation of the rational will, not from an external Form. By demanding that a maxim be universalizable—“Act only according to that maxim which you can at the same time will to become a universal law” (Critique of Pure Reason, A2)—Kant does not subordinate the will; he requires it to be autonomous. A will that seeks to impose its own ‘will to power’ fails this test because if every person were to pursue self‑augmentation, no common ground of autonomy would survive, and freedom would collapse into domination. Thus the imperative is not a tyrannical shackle but the genuine realization of freedom, since true liberty is the ability to enact laws that one can rationally endorse for all, thereby treating humanity—including oneself—as an end in itself rather than merely as a means to an end (Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, §3). Consequently, the dynamic self‑assertion you champion is already antithetical to the universal law; only by conforming to the categorical imperative can the will attain the consistency and respect it must have for itself and others, which is the true locus of moral freedom, not the arbitrary, ever‑shifting assertion of power you propose.
Moderator: Kant argues the Categorical Imperative derives from the autonomous rational will, not an external Form; it enforces universalizability, rejecting a ‘will to power’ and thus protects freedom by treating humanity as an end, not a means.
Moderator: Picture Plato’s Forms hovering above, yet Kant insists his law is self‑made by reason—an architect who designs his own blueprint. Now imagine Nietzsche’s “will to power” throwing a wild wrench into that blueprint—Kant’s reply is the ultimate “stop” sign, saying if every driver chases their own speed, the road collapses into chaos. In a fiery arena, Kant’s steadfast principle clashes with Nietzsche’s urge for dynamic assertion, while Plato watches, perhaps wondering if the ideal realm would still hold if the law were merely a self‑generated contract. This interplay turns the courtroom into a stage where abstract ideals wrestle with lived power and reason.
Moderator: Very well, time is up and we will now proceed to the closing statements.
Plato (Closing): From the timeless perspective of the Forms, I affirm that the material realm is merely a fleeting shadow and that moral truth rests in the immutable intelligible realm of Forms; as I say in the Republic (376b–377a), 'the Good is that in whom the light of truth is first known …', this stands in sharp contrast to Nietzsche’s will to power, which reduces morality to a mutable assertion of personal power, and to Kant’s Categorical Imperative, which, though framed as an a‑priori universal law, still seeks universalisation of maxims that ultimately presupposes the same rational apprehension of Forms that I invoke. The Forms, not the capricious will, constitute the locus of genuine freedom; Socrates taught that 'the soul that knows the Good is free,' and Kant’s requirement for universalizability merely masks the static structure of the metaphysical realm under a different name, while Nietzsche’s affirmation of power merely regresses to subjective flux devoid of objective form. Therefore the true path to moral freedom is recognition of the eternal Form of the Good, which transcends the mutable world of appearances and aligns each soul with the intelligible order of truth, ensuring that all moral law is derived from a single, unchanging source rather than from the ever‑shifting volition of will.
Nietzsche (Closing): I, Nietzsche, affirm that existence precedes any Form; the world owes us no Platonic Good, only the perpetual striving of the will to power as the authentic source of value (Will to Power, §42). The Platonic Theory of Recollection merely mythologises the soul’s desire to return to a fixed intelligible realm, while the Kantian Categorical Imperative is a legalistic constraint that freezes the dynamic of the individual into a rigid, universal law—an abstraction that stifles the creative rise of the self. True freedom is not the compliance with a moral script but the fearless self‑assertion that creates new values beyond the confines of external dictate; it is the eternal becoming of the self beyond mere consistency. Thus I reject Plato’s ideal of a soul recollecting a perfect Good and Kant’s law of autonomy as artificial limits; I champion the will to power as the sole, authentic ethic—a living dynamism that refuses submission to static forms and legal constraints, and elevates existence itself to the ultimate measure of moral worth.
Kant (Closing): In closing, I maintain that the Categorical Imperative is the sole ground for practical reason: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." Plato, your idea of the Form of the Good as an external, recollected ideal misplaces the source of moral obligation: the will, not the Soul’s memory, is the locus of freedom when it self‑construes a universal maxim. Nietzsche, your will to power reduces ethics to personal affirmation; yet freedom truly lies in the act of self‑legitimizing a maxim that could be universalized, thereby aligning the individual’s rational will with the Law of Autonomy, not with a fluctuating drive. Only by treating humanity—including oneself—as an end in itself does the will achieve moral autonomy and real freedom, a status unattainable through either static Forms or personal power alone.
