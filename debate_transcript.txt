Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight’s philosophical showdown on the tantalizing thesis: *“Morality is subjective.”* Our stage will host two luminaries—Ramon, a renowned moral psychologist who unpacks the cognitive underpinnings of ethical intuitions, and Dilhan, a sharp-witted ethics theorist known for championing ethical relativism in modern societies. As they clash, expect a vigorous exchange of empirical insights, philosophical rigor, and provocative anecdotes that will challenge your own moral compass; this is no mere lecture, but a spirited debate that promises to leave you questioning the very foundations of right and wrong.
Ramon (Opening): Dilhan, your premise that moral values arise from social contracts betrays the very essence of what Nietzsche declared about the will to power; as he cautions, 'the one who knows how to produce a will to power becomes a master of all values', and if we reduce morality to mere consensus we ignore the Übermensch's self‑created values—a truth that your appeal to collectivism cannot reconcile with his vision: for Friedrich Nietzsche argued that 'what a social collective seeks to impose is a repressed order of the body and mind, thus destroying the possibility of life‑affirming authenticity'. Therefore, we must reject any form of moral objectivity grounded in tradition and instead embrace the ontological freedom Nietzsche heralds, which Dilhan’s approach fails to respect.
Dilhan (Opening): Ramon, Kant maintains that moral principles are not contingent upon empirical consequences but derive from the autonomous rational will, as he articulates in the *Critique of Pure Reason* and *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*; he introduces the Categorical Imperative, declaring, 'Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law,' thereby asserting that moral duties are grounded in the necessity of rational agency and the freedom that rational beings possess, which in turn supports his argument that ethics must be grounded in pure reason rather than in subjective inclinations or societal conventions.
Moderator: Now, Ramon will present their argument.
Ramon: Dilhan, your appeal to Kant’s Categorical Imperative masks the very tyranny Nietzsche denounces: ‘The philosophers, the intellectuals, are not the ones who give us laws, but the very men who make the laws’—the “moralizers” whose dictates arise from the will to power, not from an abstract rational truth. Nietzsche rejects the idea that reason can discover moral necessities, asserting in *Beyond Good and Evil* that ‘The highest goal of the moralist is a total destruction of the world and of human life… a total death of humanity.’ He warns that the notion of universal law is a ‘moralization of the sense of self, a transformation of the self into a thing of moral value,’ thus reducing freedom to compliance. In *Genealogy*, he labels ‘rationalists’ as ‘mankind’s most resentful group,’ whose supposed neutrality merely masks their slave morality. Therefore, Kant’s pure reason is no more than a veneer for the same power structure you seek to abandon, and Nietzsche insists that moral values must be re‑invented by the Übermensch, not derived from any supposedly objective rational framework.
Moderator: Moderator Summary of Ramon's Argument: Dilhan’s appeal to Kant’s Categorical Imperative is condemned by Nietzsche as perpetuating a tyrannical, power‑driven moral hierarchy, arguing that reason cannot reveal objective moral truths and that authentic morality must be forged by the Übermensch rather than derived from abstract law.
Moderator: Moderator Commentary: Picture the debate as a clash of towers: Kant’s orderly edifice built on universal reason stands beside Nietzsche’s jagged spire of will‑to‑power. What if our moral compass were not a steady light, but a reflection of unseen forces? Let’s hear how Ramon and Dilhan will confront that provocative claim and whether Nietzsche’s call for a re‑imagined morality can outshine Kant’s timeless imperative.
Moderator: Now, Dilhan will present their argument.
Dilhan: Ramon, Kant explicitly denies that moral law is a manifestation of will‑to‑power; rather, it emerges from the autonomous rational will as a *pure practical* concept, the very essence of freedom. In the *Groundwork* he states that ‘one must act only according to that maxim whereby one can at the same time will that it should become a universal law,’ thereby making the Categorical Imperative a test of universalizability that automatically rejects any doctrine that seeks to impose a particular power structure on others, because such a maxim would fail the universal law test. Kant argues that moral laws are not derived from inclinations or social contracts but from a rational principle that all rational agents must obey – “the moral law is a law that is the same for everyone and that is only possible if all can recognize it” (Kant 1785). By elevating reason to the source of moral duties, Kant eliminates the possibility of the ‘moralizers’ as Nietzsche describes, for the will to legislate moral law is itself constrained by the rule that one must treat humanity always as an end in itself and never merely as a means (the second formulation of the Categorical Imperative). Thus Kant’s pure reason is precisely the antidote to the tyrannical, power‑driven morality Nietzsche critiques; it grounds morality in the universal, autonomous law of rationality, not in any individual or collective will.
Moderator: We are moving to the closing statements. Each philosopher will summarize their position.
Ramon (Closing): Dilhan, Nietzsche teaches that morality is not a fixed, universal law but a dynamic, life‑affirming creative force; in *Beyond Good and Evil* he warns that the ‘moralizers’ who impose law serve the will to power, condemning humanity to a ‘total death of humanity’ (Nietzsche 1886). He calls for the Übermensch to forge new values, rejecting Kant’s claim of objective rationality as merely a guise for slave morality (Nietzsche 1886). Thus, morality must emerge from continual self‑reinvention and the will’s affirmation of life, not from consensus or a rational edict that merely masks power and stifles authentic individual flourishing. 
Dilhan (Closing): Ramon, your invocation of Nietzsche’s will to power misinterprets Kant’s notion of autonomy; Kant holds that moral law is a “pure practical” concept arising from a rational will, articulated in the Categorical Imperative “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law” (Groundwork, 1785), thereby rejecting arbitrary power structures; this universalizability test ensures that any maxim promoting domination fails, because it cannot be willed as a universal law; likewise, Kant’s second formulation commands that “treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of any other, always at the same time as an end and never merely as a means” (Groundwork, 1785), which directly opposes the tyrannical imposition you suggest; thus, morality is not a fluid, personal flourish but an objective, rational necessity grounded in the freedom that all rational agents share, making Kant’s ethical system the definitive antidote to the relativism you champion.
